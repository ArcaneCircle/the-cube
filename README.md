# webxdc-cube

A Rubik's Cube Game for Delta Chat

[Original project](https://bsehovac.github.io/the-cube/) ([repo](https://github.com/bsehovac/the-cube))

## How to build the game (`.xdc` file)

Just run the `build` script (`npm run build`, `yarn build` or `pnpm build`) and you will get a `.xdc` file in the root of the project, then send that file in any chat to play.
